LightOpenIDClient

Finally I found a "Light"-weight "OpenID" implementation in PHP, I just didn't
like its interface (really no offense, it's just a thing I have). So what do 
you do? Create a little client interface around it and push it to GitHub.

LightOpenID is hosted on Gitorious and is here included as a Git submodule. 
Minimal survival steps:

$ git clone http://github.com/christophevg/LightOpenIDClient.git LightOpenIDClient
$ cd LightOpenIDClient
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Now you are ready to take a look at the demo.php page to see how it simplifies
using LightOpenID - I hope ;-)

All credits go to Mewp for his great work on LightOpenID.
